Summary of what is different between Original and Short version:

Main considerations while reviewing:
- Discussion needs more attention than the introduction
- I do not refer to supplementary 8 in the text (it's the MDF linearized investigation) directly, not sure we should keep it in or not? 
- Does the order of the supplementary make sense?

In general, reduced the size of the figures

Introduction
-	Moved to supp the figure and section about the Wilson-Cowan model
-	Move to supp section: “Tracing the roots of NPMs: early history”
-	Removed explanation about the other hypothesis of alpha that we are not exploring
-	Rewrote “Bridging scales” section
-	When talking about abnormal alpha, just put the examples, without going into details (annoted in a comment)
-	Removed paragraph about conductance-based model in “Classification of NPMs and mathematical ..”
Methods
-	Derivation of the stability of JR and LW moved to Supplementary (S3)
-	Reduced the size of the figures (scale of 0.35 instead of 0.45)
-	For all the models, removed the brain image, transfer function equations and output
-	Removed any text relating to TF 
Results
-	In Figure 9, removed the TF results all together, and put the EC-EO on one line. 
-	Removed separate paragraph for “Topology”, “Equations” and “Unified parameter table” in  “Comparative evaluation of the model”, and summarized all the results into one paragraph instead

Discussion:
-	Removed the section “Alternative models of alpha rhythm beyond NPMs”
-	Reduced and rewrote section “Summary of main findings”
-	Severely reduced and rewrote section “Model limitations and critique” 


Added Supplementary information content:
-	Transfer function
-	Stability analysis derivation
-	Section: “Tracing the roots of NPMs: early history”

Note: Since had to remove WC figure, had to change all the numbering of the figures + same for supplementary
